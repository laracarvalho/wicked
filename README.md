# Wicked

A HTML5 & Sass boilerplate and library for sane projects.

## Features

Wicked is a starting point for projects, so it doesn't come with many color declarations, except grayscale. What it does come with:

- A responsive and simple grid based on Flexbox;
- A reset file that doesn't extend itself too much;
- A helper file filled with accessibility concern implementations and a few helper classes;
- A semantically correct and starter-ready HTML5 file;
- Robots file ready to be edited;
- Site Web Manifest file for PWA.

## Usage

- Simply ```git clone``` this repository;
- Use the ```npm run start``` script to watch for differences in your files.

## Dependencies

The only depencency you'll need right off the bat is ```sass```.

## TO-DO

There's still a lot to develop for Wicked. My roadmap:

- Easy config minification of css files.
- Create a page to showcase and document Wicked's features.
- Extend Wicked to a separate publishable repo for reutilization or develop a base theme to use Wicked just like Bootstrap.
